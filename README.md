# parseVocabGHP
Parse vocabulary terms

* This is the GitHub Pages repo for serving my custom MS Word add-in to parse vocab terms.

* One needs to "Side-load" the add-in in order to run it. A link on how to side-load can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-an-office-add-in-in-office-on-the-web
